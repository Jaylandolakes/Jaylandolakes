Hello! I'm a Self-Taught Coding Enthusiast -- Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm Landolakes, and I'm diving headfirst into the world of web development. Currently, I'm focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as I build my skills and embark on this exciting journey. Here's a bit about me and what you can find on my profile:

About Me

- Learning Path: I’m self-teaching myself web development with a passion for creating interactive and visually appealing websites.

- Current Focus: HTML for structuring content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for adding dynamic functionality.

- Goals: To build my coding portfolio, work on real-world projects, and eventually contribute to open-source projects.

What You’ll Find Here

- Projects: A collection of my projects where I practice and apply what I’m learning. Expect to see everything from simple static webpages to more complex interactive applications.

- Code Examples: Snippets and mini-projects that demonstrate various concepts in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- Learning Resources: Links to tutorials, articles, and tools that have helped me along the way. 

Get in Touch

Feel free to check out my repositories and leave feedback. I’m always open to constructive criticism, suggestions, or just a friendly chat about web development.

Thanks for stopping by, and happy coding!
